                    <h3><a href="#">Valorant</a></h3>
                    <p>Valorant is a popular team-based online multiplayer first-person shooter game developed and published by Riot Games. The game was officially released on June 2, 2020. In the game, players form two teams of five players each, and each player selects a unique character called an "agent," each with its own set of abilities and skills.

                        The objective of the game is to either eliminate all the players on the opposing team or to complete a specific objective, such as planting or defusing a bomb. The game is designed to be highly competitive, and players can advance through various ranks and tiers by winning matches and improving their skills.
                        
                        Valorant has gained a massive following since its release and is considered one of the most popular esports titles, with several major tournaments and leagues being held worldwide. The game is available for free on PC, and players can purchase in-game cosmetic items and other features through microtransactions.

                    <h3><a href="#">Best Duelist in Valorant</a></h3>
                    <p>There is no one definitive answer to who is the best duelist in Valorant, as opinions can vary depending on a player's individual preferences and playstyle. However, there are some agents that are often considered to be strong duelists due to their abilities and playstyle.

                        Jett, for example, is a highly mobile agent with abilities that allow her to quickly move around the map and dodge enemy fire. She can also create smokescreens that can provide cover and confuse her opponents.
                        
                        Another popular duelist is Reyna, whose abilities allow her to heal herself after getting a kill and temporarily become invulnerable. She can also create a blinding orb that can disorient enemies and allow her to get the upper hand in a fight.
                        
                        Other duelists such as Phoenix, Raze, and Yoru are also popular choices due to their abilities and playstyle. Ultimately, the best duelist for a player will depend on their individual preferences and skill level.

                    <h3><a href="#">Best Healer in Valorant</a></h3>
                    <p>The only agent in Valorant that has healing abilities is Sage. She is considered the best healer in the game as her abilities are focused on supporting her teammates with heals, resurrection, and barriers.

                        Sage has two healing abilities: "Heal" and "Barrier Orb." "Heal" is an ability that allows her to heal a teammate's health over time. This ability is especially useful in clutch situations where a teammate is low on health, and Sage can quickly heal them to full health.
                        
                        Her "Barrier Orb" ability is used to block enemy movement and bullets. This can be useful for blocking off certain routes and providing cover for her teammates, allowing them to reposition or attack safely.
                        
                        Sage's ultimate ability is called "Resurrection." It allows her to bring a dead teammate back to life with full health. This ultimate can turn the tide of a match, especially in a crucial moment where a team needs all of their members to win a round.
                        
                        Overall, Sage is an essential agent for any team looking for a reliable healer and support agent in Valorant.
